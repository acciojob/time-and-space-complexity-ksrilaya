	<h1>Time, Space,and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the quantification of the amount of time taken by a set of code or algorithm to process or run as a function of the amount of input.
		In other words, time complexity is essentially efficiency, or how long a program function takes to process a given input.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>space complexity</b> is the measurement of total space required by an algorithm to execute properly. It also includes memory required by input variables.
		<b>Space complexity</b> is the parallel concept to time complexity. For example, if we want to initialize an array of integers, then its space complexity would be O(n)
